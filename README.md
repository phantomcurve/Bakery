## Description

This console app demonstrates the power of the C# namespace to separate logic to create a neat console app for the fictional Pierre's Bakery. The app allows the user to submit an order for loaves of bread and pastries, including promotional pricing deals, and ultimately lets the user know how much their order will cost!
